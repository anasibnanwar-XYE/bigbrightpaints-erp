Lane: `w2`
Branch: `tickets/tkt-erp-stage-052/refactor-techdebt-gc`

## Objective
M18-S3 payroll posting canonicality: fail closed when POSTED payroll run lacks journal linkage to prevent duplicate postings

## Agent Write Boundary (Enforced)
- `erp-domain/src/main/java/`
- `erp-domain/src/test/java/`
- `docs/`

## Requested Focus Paths
- `erp-domain/src/test/java/com/bigbrightpaints/erp/truthsuite/payroll/TS_PayrollLiabilityClearingPolicyTest.java`

## Required Checks Before Done
- `bash ci/check-architecture.sh`
- `cd erp-domain && mvn -B -ntp test`

## Reviewer Contract
- Review-only agents do not commit code.
- Add one review file per reviewer under `tickets/<id>/slices/<slice>/reviews/`.
- Mark review status as `approved` only with concrete evidence.

## Shipability Bar
- The patch must be minimal, deterministic, and test-backed.
- Do not change behavior outside explicit scope without evidence and rationale.
- If any safety invariant is uncertain, fail closed and document blocker with evidence.
